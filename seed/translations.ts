    explanation:
      "Delivery Forensics is the pre-hoc forensic discipline: doing the GAO/IG-style structural and procurement analysis before the failure manifests. FMEA is the closest existing tool inside the Six Sigma/TQM lineage but is built for manufacturing-defect failure modes, not political and structural ones. The cleaner positioning is as the pre-hoc complement to GAO post-hoc work — it locates the practice in a public-sector accountability tradition rather than a private-sector quality one.",
    whenToUseYours:
      "When you're inside a public-sector accountability conversation (GAO, IG, OMB, agency leadership) and need a frame that names political/structural failure modes as the actual unit of analysis. Also when the audience would hear 'FMEA' as cosplay rather than substance.",
    whenToUseTheirs:
      "Use 'FMEA' when you need legibility with procurement officers, federal PMOs, CMMI-shaped organizations, or anyone whose mental model is Six Sigma. Use 'GAO post-program review' when contrasting with after-the-fact forensics to make the pre-hoc claim concrete.",

    explanation:
      "Six Sigma's variance-around-a-stable-process model doesn't map. The closer analogs are Deming's PDCA extended into continuous anticipation, Toyota's hoshin kanri (policy deployment with structured course correction), SPC's notion of process drift applied to outcomes, and aerospace/systems-engineering trajectory correction maneuvers. Trajectory Management names the practice of continuous vector-to-outcome assessment between milestone reviews — the thing milestone-based governance systematically misses.",
    whenToUseYours:
      "Public-sector program health conversations where 'trajectory' makes the moving-environment claim explicit, and where 'we're on track' (the milestone-review answer) is the wrong unit of analysis.",
    whenToUseTheirs:
      "'Hoshin kanri' if the audience speaks Lean. 'PDCA' for the broadest legibility. 'SPC drift' for quants and manufacturing-quality audiences. 'Program steering' as a neutral fallback that signals you're talking about ongoing course adjustment rather than after-the-fact review.",

    standardTerms: ["Six Sigma", "Lean", "TQM", "DMAIC", "CMMI"],
    explanation:
      "Meta-translation. The quality movement gave the private sector pre-hoc disciplines for manufacturing and software — Six Sigma, Lean, TQM, DMAIC. Public services never got an equivalent, because the failure modes are political and structural rather than statistical. Delivery Forensics and Trajectory Management are positioned as that equivalent: pre-hoc disciplines for public-sector delivery risk, drawing on the GAO/IG accountability tradition rather than the manufacturing-quality tradition. This translation row exists so the search 'Six Sigma' surfaces the positioning argument as well as the individual framework entries.",
    whenToUseYours:
      "When you want to make the conceptual claim about public-sector quality discipline without inheriting the manufacturing-era baggage of Six Sigma's reputation (post-GE consulting product, methodology cosplay).",
    whenToUseTheirs:
      "Use Six Sigma / Lean / TQM language when the audience lives inside a CMMI-shaped organization and the cost of unfamiliar vocabulary outweighs the cost of conceptual borrowing. The translation buys legibility with procurement officers and federal PMOs in particular.",
